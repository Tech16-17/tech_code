<p>The modern hotel Stars 
rating system aims to rate hotels based on the quality and amount of amenities they provide their customers. ... Probable amenities include valet parking, room service, and a fitness center and/or pool.</p>
            <p>In the United States, the 5-star rating system was started by the least likely of companies - an oil and gas company! You see, Mobil, the same gas station company that you probably have seen while driving around, started making travel guides, and started using the 5-star system to rate different hotels. Eventually, others started to emulate the gas and oil giant, and the new system spread quickly.
